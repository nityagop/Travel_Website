<p> We went to California during our "Fall Break" and we visited Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Fransisco. Our tripwas about a week long, In LA on our first day  we (of course) visited  Hollywood Blvd. and saw all the celebrities stars,the Chinese Theater, and also took a tour that showed us celebrity mansions. On our second day we went to Universal Studios. After staying in LA we went to Santa Barbara and visited the beach and had lunch on the pier. Next we drove to my uncles house in San Jose. While driving we stopped by Pismo Beach and Pebble Beach. After reaching my Uncle's the next day we went to San Fransisco and saw the Golden Gate Bridge, the Full House home, and much more. Our last full day in California we spent with my cousins back in San Jose and visited Cupertino (Apple Headquarters) and the Stanford college campus. </p>
